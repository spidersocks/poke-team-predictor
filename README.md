# üîÆ VGC Restricted Core Teammate Predictor

This interactive tool predicts the most likely teammates for a given pair of restricted Pok√©mon in VGC Regulation I, based on battle data collected from Pok√©mon Showdown BO3 matches.

It uses a trained supervised machine learning model to identify common patterns and displays the results with sprite images and probabilities in a visual grid.

## üß† How It Works

- Choose two restricted Pok√©mon from dropdown menus  
- Click **Predict Teammates**  
- The top 10 most likely partners will be shown with:  
  - Official sprites via [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/)  
  - Predicted co-occurrence probabilities  
  - Clean grid layout for comparison

## üìù About the Project

This is part of our Milestone II project for the University of Michigan, focused on understanding competitive Pok√©mon team composition using supervised and unsupervised learning.
